# Reggae-Horn-V-2.0
A fun "horn" project for your motorcycle or other vehicle

This is a project that I made for my little 125 SSR Razkull motorcycle. I found, by almost getting floored by a driver that was texting, that the stock horn is not very effective. So I decided to create a horn that really couldn't be ignored. Its LOUD, very effective and not too hard to build. I added a couple of "fun" features to this project also.

"This is not intended to be a replacement for a DOT approved horn. Use reponsibly". There... I said it.
